            <p>Hello there! My name is Stuart and I am currently attending the full stack development coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota. I have a bachelor's of science in Biology: Environmental Conservation from Rogers State University. I spent some time interning and volunteering with the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation near the end of, and after the completion of, my degree.
                In 2019 I moved to Minnesota with my partner to be closer to some family and for her to be able to start her own art business. Since the launch of her company we both have been working on that to get it off the ground and running! Throughout the pandemic we have remained working from home. I have gone through a number of ventures from refinishing and reselling furniture to creating arts and crafts.
                While doing numerous projects from home was enjoyable, I realized that long term that's not really what I wanted to do. After much thought and consideration I decided to get into coding. I have always been in love with tech even from a young age and have always thought about going into the field in some capacity, but I decided now was the time to finally follow through. I'm looking forward to continuing down this path and seeing where my career leads me!
            </p>
